        bio: 'Jake Weatherald (born 4 November 1994) is an Australian cricketer who plays as an opening batsman in domestic level for South Australia and the Adelaide Strikers. He is also the CEO of a startup, Champs 4 Grabs, which he co-founded with teammates Travis Head and Alex Carey. \r\n' +
          'Weatherald, unlike other A-listers in the team, did not really have solid groundings from the very beginning of his cricket career. He joined the South Australian Redbacks at age 21 and had a breakout 2016, which ended with him landing the Adelaide Strikers-- and scoring 50 on BBL debut. He went on to score the first ever hundred in a BBL final, at the BBL07 final. \r\n' +
          'An uncapped Australian, Weatherald believes in working hard and giving your 100% if you are to expect definite results. This approach was well followed, as seen in his intense 8-hour training routine, which he is believed to have applied while learning the guitar as well-- an approach he learnt from guitar god Tom Morello. Weatherald is also known to be a talented dancer off the field. Like Travis Head, he also takes the lead role in various talent shows, besides TikTok and Instagram reels dance videos. \r\n' +
          "Weatherald has been actively involved in Strikers club activities such as People's Choice Quick Singles, Defender and Google Feud. He is even known to have taken the Jackbox Party Pack to his teammates with the Strikers, and the Fantastic Four-- himself, Head, Alex Carey and ex-wife Penny, morphed into what is now Australia's leading community Champs 4 Grabs. He is the owner of the C4G Discord server, and has been the best at Among Us in 2021, according to community statistics. \r\n" +
          `Weatherald also hosts regular seasons of Discord's Got Talent, a Discord-based talent show. He shares Among Us gameplay videos and has started producing Discord skit videos in the style of Beluga. Weatherald is known to despise "hackers" in Among Us, and everyone knows him by his signature "Ladies and gentlemen" to which crewmates reply "We got 'em!" Weatherald's best friend Mitch "Momentum" Rowell is the technical lead at C4G, while WA's Jhye Richardson is his right-hand man. He owns an EP "Don't Say I Didn't Warn You", a collections of guitar solos, some of which even have vocals. He has even coached junior levels at Adelaide University CC.\r\n`,

        bio: 'Jhye Avon Richardson (born 20 September 1996) is an Australian cricketer who plays as a fast bowling allrounder for Australia, Western Australia and Perth Scorchers. \r\n' +
          "Erm. Enough of the boring on-field stuff. Let's move on to the life and lies of Jhye Richardson. \r\n" +
          `Richardson is a free-spirited youngster who swears by his coach Justin Langer's success mantras. His life motto, 'Keep it Simple, Stupid' was one of the many principles Langer lived by during his cricketing days, and Richardson lives up to it, through unique ways to remind himself of it, such as writing it on his shoes, or setting it as his Discord status. Richardson attributes his success to the belief of keeping himself positive at every game. "If you go into every game thinking you're going to get injured, you probably don't have the right mentality. I'm always going to put my body on the line for my team. It's what my team needs from me at that moment. I'd be happy to do it again if I have to," says the 26-year-old. \r\n` +
          "Since being a member at Champs 4 Grabs in early 2021, his lively interactions have earned him a promotion to moderator, admin, community manager-- and finally, the CEO Jake Weatherald's right-hand man. Fans can witness him either playing Rocket League, COD or Among Us; or chatting with his closest friends including Weatherald, Josh Philippe, Marcus Stoinis, or his partner Penny. He is known to be very close friends with Canadian YouTuber and musician Steve Terreberry, aka Stevie T, and was involved in a series of collaborations with him. \r\n" +
          `Richardson believes a lot has changed since meeting 'Pez', and he's had a new perspective about relationships. "A lot of my peers who are in serious relationships must've met their partners in high school or something like that, but literally, anything can happen in that case. The girl who was there at your Baggy Breen presentation or who was there to witness your first hat-trick in test cricket may not always be your constant-- neither your first fiancee. Pez and I have learnt a lot together, and she's supported me in a way no one else might have; at C4G and the Scorchers, and that's what made her my... constant? We're happy with the way things are going at the moment. Relationships are not just about engagements, marriage, kids, photos on the mantel or travelling the world together. And it's defilitely not about trying to change yourself to please the other person. It's about learning from each other, supporting each other and making progress together."\r\n`,
